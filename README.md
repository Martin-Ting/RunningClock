# RunningClock
This project was designed by me for the "custom lab" project for CS120b at UC Riverside. I also prototyped a device on a breadboard based on the ATMega1284 microcontroller. This portion of the repository holds my prototyping code for each hardware element I used and the final integrated design of my "running clock." 

The "Running clock" is an alarm clock design that allows the alarm clock to drive away from its resting position when an alarm is triggered. When you're alarm is running, you have to run after it to turn it off. This ensures that you will wake up and be ready to start your day! It also plays custom music and tracks based on popular movies and video games.

This repo also has the lab exercises I completed for simpler hardware systems.
